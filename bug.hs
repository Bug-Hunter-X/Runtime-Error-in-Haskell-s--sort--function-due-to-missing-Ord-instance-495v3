```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```

This code compiles without error, but it may not produce the expected result if the input list `xs` contains elements that are not comparable using the default `Ord` instance. For example, if `xs` contains a mix of `Int` and `String` values, the `sort` function will throw a runtime error.
